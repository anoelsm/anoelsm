Hi! I am Alaina N. Smith, a PhD candidate in the Biological Oceanography program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
I am advised by Dr. Andrew Barton on my work utilizing numerical modeling and data analysis to study phytoplankton temperature niches

Broadly, I am interested in phytoplankton diversity and biogeography with a focus on utilizing theoretical modeling and advanced data analysis tools. 
I work mainly in R but I'm also proficient in MatLab and Python, and enjoy learning new platforms for analysis and visualization. 

I can be reached at ans132@ucsd.edu. For more info check out my website: alainanoel-smith.com
